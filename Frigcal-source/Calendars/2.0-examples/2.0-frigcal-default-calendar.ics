 =================================\n[Full description]\n\nExample Unicode s
 ymbols and text for copy/paste use in frigcal events.  \n\nWHY THESE WORK:
 \n  These all work in calendar files\, because the underlying 3rd-party \n
   icalendar parser/generator library leveraged by frigcal uses general\n  
 UTF-8 Unicode text throughout.\n\n  These all work in GUI displays too\, b
 ecause Python's Tk/tkinter \n  GUI library also supports Unicode - they ma
 y be input and render \n  well in frigcal\, as well as PP4E's PyEdit text 
 editor (which also\n  saves and loads text in Unicode files) and PyMailGUI
  email client \n  (which also encodes and decodes text per MIME Unicode co
 nventions).\n\nSUPPORT IN EDITORS AND FRIGCAL:\n  This file itself is save
 d in the general UTF-8 encoding format\, which \n  allows characters from 
 multiple languages to be mixed.  Notepad does \n  roughly as well as PyEdi
 t for this file's characters encoding\, but \n  neither it nor Tk support 
 every Unicode character (TextEdit seems\n  to do better on Unix\, and PyEd
 it does better everywhere).\n\n  See frigcal version 1.7 release notes in 
 UserGuide.html for more \n  details on frigcal's support.  In short\, Tk 8
 .6\, its latest version \n  at this writing\, is limited to Unicode charac
 ters having code points \n  in the range U+0000...U+FFFF (i.e.\, the BMP)\
 , but may support others \n  (e.g.\, new emojis) in a future Tk 8.7\, that
  future Pythons may adopt.\n\n  That said\, Tk handles all modern language
 s\, many symbols\, and all the \n  text in this file well\, in font famili
 es Courier\, Times\, Helvetica\, \n  Arial\, Consolas\, Lucinda\, and more
  (Tk searches for a glyph in all \n  its fonts\, if absent in the family b
 eing used).  \n\nUSAGE NOTES AND POINTERS:\n  Note that some of these may 
 impact GUI speed on some platforms (Mac\n  Tk may render a few slowly in s
 ome fonts in rare cases).  Also note \n  that symbol appearance may vary p
 er platform\, and a few may not be \n  supported everywhere: paste these i
 nto a frigcal event-edit dialog \n  or PyEdit edit window to see how Tk re
 nders them on your computer.\n\nFOR MORE EXAMPLES\n  For more Unicode symb
 ols and characters to use in frigcal\, try the \n  following links\, and s
 elect characters there whose code points are \n  in the range U+0000...U+F
 FFF\, per UserGuide.html's 1.7 notes:\n\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
 /Miscellaneous_Symbols\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_symbols\
