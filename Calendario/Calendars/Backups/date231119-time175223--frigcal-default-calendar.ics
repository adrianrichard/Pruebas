 ==========================================\n[Full description]\n\nExample 
 Unicode symbols and text for copy/paste use in frigcal events.  \n\nWHY TH
 ESE WORK:\n  These all work in calendar files\, because the underlying 3rd
 -party \n  icalendar parser/generator library leveraged by frigcal uses ge
 neral\n  UTF-8 Unicode text throughout.\n\n  These all work in GUI display
 s too\, because Python's Tk/tkinter \n  GUI library also supports Unicode 
 - they may be input and render \n  well in frigcal\, as well as PP4E's PyE
 dit text editor (which also\n  saves and loads text in Unicode files) and 
 PyMailGUI email client \n  (which also encodes and decodes text per MIME U
 nicode conventions).\n\nSUPPORT IN EDITORS AND FRIGCAL:\n  This file itsel
 f is saved in the general UTF-8 encoding format\, which \n  allows charact
 ers from multiple languages to be mixed.  Notepad does \n  roughly as well
  as PyEdit for this file's characters encoding\, but \n  neither it nor Tk
  support every Unicode character (TextEdit seems\n  to do better on Unix\,
  and PyEdit does better everywhere).\n\n  See frigcal version 1.7 release 
 notes in DeveloperGuide.html for more \n  details on frigcal's support.  I
 n short\, Tk 8.6\, its latest version \n  at this writing\, is limited to 
 Unicode characters having code points \n  in the range U+0000...U+FFFF (i.
 e.\, the BMP)\, but may support others \n  (e.g.\, new emojis) in a future
  Tk 8.7\, that future Pythons may adopt.\n\n  That said\, Tk handles all m
 odern languages\, many symbols\, and all the \n  text in this file well\, 
 in font families Courier\, Times\, Helvetica\, \n  Arial\, Consolas\, Luci
 nda\, and more (Tk searches for a glyph in all \n  its fonts\, if absent i
 n the family being used).  \n\nUSAGE NOTES AND POINTERS:\n  Note that some
  of these may impact GUI speed on some platforms (Mac\n  Tk may render a f
 ew slowly in some fonts in rare cases).  Also note \n  that symbol appeara
 nce may vary per platform\, and a few may not be \n  supported everywhere:
  paste these into a frigcal event-edit dialog \n  or PyEdit edit window to
  see how Tk renders them on your computer.\n\nFOR MORE EXAMPLES\n  For mor
 e Unicode symbols and characters to use in frigcal\, try the \n  following
  links\, and select characters there whose code points are \n  in the rang
 e U+0000...U+FFFF\, per UserGuide.html's 1.7 notes:\n\n    https://en.wiki
 pedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un
