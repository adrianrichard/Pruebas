 =================================\n[Full description]\n\nExample Unicode s
 ymbols and text for copy/paste use in frigcal events.  \n\nWHY THESE WORK:
 \n  These all work in calendar files\, because the underlying 3rd-party \n
   icalendar parser/generator library leveraged by frigcal uses general\n  
 UTF-8 Unicode text throughout.\n\n  These all work in GUI displays too\, b
 ecause Python's Tk/tkinter \n  GUI library also supports Unicode - they ma
 y be input and render \n  well in frigcal\, as well as PP4E's PyEdit text 
 editor (which also\n  saves and loads text in Unicode files) and PyMailGUI
  email client \n  (which also encodes and decodes text per MIME Unicode co
 nventions).\n\nSUPPORT IN EDITORS AND FRIGCAL:\n  This file itself is save
 d in the general UTF-8 encoding format\, which \n  allows characters from 
 multiple languages to be mixed.  Notepad does \n  roughly as well as PyEdi
 t for this file's characters encoding\, but \n  neither it nor Tk support 
 every Unicode character (TextEdit seems\n  to do better on Unix\, and PyEd
 it does better everywhere).\n\n  See frigcal version 1.7 release notes in 
 DeveloperGuide.html for more \n  details on frigcal's support.  In short\,
  Tk 8.6\, its latest version \n  at this writing\, is limited to Unicode c
 haracters having code points \n  in the range U+0000...U+FFFF (i.e.\, the 
 BMP)\, but may support others \n  (e.g.\, new emojis) in a future Tk 8.7\,
  that future Pythons may adopt.\n\n  That said\, Tk handles all modern lan
 guages\, many symbols\, and all the \n  text in this file well\, in font f
 amilies Courier\, Times\, Helvetica\, \n  Arial\, Consolas\, Lucinda\, and
  more (Tk searches for a glyph in all \n  its fonts\, if absent in the fam
 ily being used).  \n\nUSAGE NOTES AND POINTERS:\n  Note that some of these
  may impact GUI speed on some platforms (Mac\n  Tk may render a few slowly
  in some fonts in rare cases).  Also note \n  that symbol appearance may v
 ary per platform\, and a few may not be \n  supported everywhere: paste th
 ese into a frigcal event-edit dialog \n  or PyEdit edit window to see how 
 Tk renders them on your computer.\n\nFOR MORE EXAMPLES\n  For more Unicode
  symbols and characters to use in frigcal\, try the \n  following links\, 
 and select characters there whose code points are \n  in the range U+0000.
